# Setting up for tests
Make sure to first go into the `server/` directory.

## Local firebase emulators
Make sure the Firebase CLI is installed, using the command `firebase --version`
If it isn't installed you can generally install it using `npm install -g firebase-tools`
You can check out [Firebase CLI Reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm) for more information.

At this point, you should be able to run `firebase emulators:start` inside of the `server/` directory. If it isn't you can initialize it using `firebase init emulators`. We only need `firestore` for our project.

See this link [Install and Configure Local Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure) for more information.

## Typesense

TBD if there is an easy way to do this. Typesense needs to be installed and its API key in the env file (currently Typesense only works with a local Typesense session).

More information about setting up Typesense can be found [here](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
